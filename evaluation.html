                        <p>In Phase 1, we adopted a combination of a 3B model and a lightweight embedding model, with a total memory requirement of no more than 16GB, ensuring that it could run on most mainstream devices with 16GB of RAM.</p>
                        <p>In Phase 2, we provided users with three model options: 8B, 3B, and OpenAI API. If the user's device has lower performance, such as a mobile device or an older computer, they can choose to run the 3B model or use OpenAI's API. While if the user's device has better performance and they want better use experience, they can choose the 8B model.</p>

                        <p>For our project's maintainability, we have structured our code by writing separate functions for different features, making it easier to modify and update specific functionalities without affecting the entire system. This modular approach enhances the readability and scalability of our code. </p>
                        <p>However, one drawback is that bug fixes and patches were not well managed. Some patches were added without proper documentation or organization, which could lead to difficulties in tracking and maintaining in the long run.</p>
                        <p>Overall, we think we did a good job in Project maintainability, but we also have some drawback that can be improved in future project.</p>

                    <p>During the project showcase day, we demonstrated our demo to many guests and recorded their user experiences and suggestions. Many users were amazed by our product and found it very useful. Of course, we also received some suggestions for improvement.</p>
                    <p>One particularly valuable suggestion was whether our project could be integrated with visual input devices, such as eye-tracking technology, to help users input their thoughts more quickly. This is especially relevant because our target users typically have mobility disabilities. While our product helps reduce the amount of input required, entering keywords can still be quite challenging for them. This suggestion is very useful and has provided inspiration for our future plans.</p>

                <h1>Future Work</h1>
                <h3>Integration with Visual Input Devices</h3>
                <p>One particularly valuable improvement we plan to test is the integration of our project with visual input devices, such as eye-tracking technology. This would allow users to input their thoughts faster. This feature is especially important because our target users often have mobility disabilities, making traditional input methods challenging. While our product already helps reduce the amount of input required, entering keywords can still be difficult for some users. By incorporating visual input technology, we aim to make our product more accessible, efficient, and user-friendly for those who need it most.</p>
                <h3>Expanding Compatibility Across More Devices</h3>
                <p>We aim to optimize our project for more devices, particularly mobile devices. This will ensure that users can run the software on a wider range of hardware, improving accessibility and flexibility.</p>
                <h3>Embedding voice on client side</h3>
                <p>The initial plan to completely have voice cloning on the client side was hindered by difficulty and complexities in creating a transformers pipeline for the voice embedding models. Hence in the future with more research and knowledge in this field, we plan to integrate the voice embedding to the client side through creating a transformers pipeline.</p>
                <h3>Third-Party Software Integration</h3>  
                <p>We plan to integrate our project with third-party applications, such as WhatsApp. This will enable users to access and use our software directly within their chat apps, eliminating the need to open a separate application. This seamless integration will enhance user convenience and improve the overall experience.</p>
